# Be informed

During a wildfire, smoke conditions can change quickly over short
distances and can vary considerably hour-by-hour.

Wildfire smoke is a natural part of our environment but it is important
to be mindful that exposure to smoke may affect your health.

People with pre-existing health conditions, respiratory infections such
as COVID-19, older adults, pregnant women and infants, children, and
sensitive individuals are more likely to experience health effects from
smoke exposure.

# During smoky conditions

## Follow your common sense

-   Stop or reduce your activity level if breathing becomes
    uncomfortable or you feel unwell.

-   Stay cool and drink plenty of fluids.

-   If you have asthma or other chronic illness, carry any rescue
    (fast-acting) medications with you at all times and activate your
    personal care plan that has been designed with your family
    physician.

Make sure that children and others who cannot care for themselves follow
the same advice.

## Monitor your symptoms

-   People respond differently to smoke. Mild irritation and discomfort
    are common, and usually disappear when the smoke clears.

-   If you are unsure whether you need medical care, call HealthLink BC
    at 8-1-1.

-   If you are experiencing difficulty in breathing, chest pain or
    discomfort, or a severe cough, contact your health care provider,
    walk-in clinic, or emergency department. If you are having a medical
    emergency, call 9-1-1.

## Tips to reduce your smoke exposure

-   Smoke levels may be lower indoors but will still be elevated, so
    stay aware of your symptoms even when you are indoors.

-   Running a commercially available HEPA (high efficiency particulate
    air) filter can improve indoor air quality in the room where the
    device is located.

-   If you have a forced air heating/cooling system in your home, it may
    help to change the filter and set the fan to run continuously.

-   Reduce indoor air pollution sources such as smoking, burning
    incense, and frying foods.

-   Consider going to a library, community center, or shopping mall with
    cooler filtered air to get some relief from the smoke.

-   If travelling in a car with air conditioning, keep the windows up
    and the ventilation set to recirculate.

-   If you are very sensitive to smoke, consider moving to another
    location with cleaner air, but be aware that conditions can change
    rapidly.

-   Maintaining good overall health is a good way to prevent health
    effects resulting from short-term exposure to air pollution.
